This is an Elixir Phoenix LiveView web site for the [Greece |> Elixir](https://greecex.org) community. The community's purpose is to promote Elixir and its ecosystem in Greece, foster a vibrant developer community, and make Elixir one of the most widely used language in the country.

## Team

This is an initiative started in Feb 2025 by [Petros](https://petros.blog) (that's me, yay!). My love for the Elixir language and its ecosystem, my previous experience co-organizing the Thessaloniki Ruby Meetup for years, and the almost non-existant Greek community, made me want to help grow it.

### Wanna help?

Are you interested in helping? Please [shoot an email](mailto:petros@amignosis.com?subject=Help%20with%20Greecex) with a few details about you, your background, and why you'd love to help.

## Why Amignosis?

This project is a little <img src="priv/static/images/star.png" alt="star" width="20" align="absmiddle"> created by [Amignosis](https://amignosis.com), my personal company. [Little stars](https://amignosis.com/stars) is how I refer to my projects.

I'm using my personal company as the vehicle to run **Greece |> Elixir** for a few practical reasons:

- **Simplicity** – Creating a separate entity for the community would add unnecessary overhead. Running it through Amignosis keeps things lightweight and efficient.

- **Transparency** – As an independent effort, it ensures clarity and avoids external commercial influence.

- **Sustainability** – Hosting, domain registration, and event costs can be covered seamlessly.

- **Flexibility** – It allows for quick decisions and experimentation without bureaucratic constraints.

The goal remains the same: to **grow the Elixir community in Greece** and make it one of the most widely used programming languages in the country. Amignosis is simply the means to make that happen. When this grows enough, we can always spawn a separate entity.
