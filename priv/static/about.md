# About

You have visited the Greece |> Elixir community. The community's purpose is to promote Elixir and its ecosystem in Greece, foster a vibrant developer community, and make Elixir one of the most widely used language in the country.

## Team

This is an initiative started in Feb 2025 by [Petros](https://petros.blog) (that's me, yay!). My love for the Elixir language and its ecosystem, my previous experience co-organizing the Thessaloniki Ruby Meetup for years, and the almost non-existant Greek community, made me want to help grow it.

### Wanna help?

Please [subscribe](/subscribe) to the community and share a few details about you, your background, and why you'd love to help.

## Why Amignosis?

This project is a little star created by [Amignosis](https://amignosis.com), my personal company. [Little stars](https://amignosis.com/stars) is how I refer to my projects.

I'm using my personal company as the vehicle to run **Greece |> Elixir** for a few practical reasons:

- **Simplicity** – Creating a separate entity for the community would add unnecessary overhead. Running it through Amignosis keeps things lightweight and efficient.

- **Transparency** – As an independent effort, it ensures clarity and avoids external commercial influence.

- **Sustainability** – Hosting, domain registration, and event costs can be covered seamlessly.

- **Flexibility** – It allows for quick decisions and experimentation without bureaucratic constraints.

The goal remains the same: to **grow the Elixir community in Greece** and make it one of the most widely used programming languages in the country. Amignosis is simply the means to make that happen. When this grows enough, we can always spawn a separate entity.

## Open source

The code for this site is open source and you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/greecex/greecex). This means you can choose to contribute to it, and thus help growing the community. You can also learn from it. It's by far NOT the best code Elixir Phoenix code out there. But with the community's help, we wish to see it become a great example of an ideal Phoenix web app.
